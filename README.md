Quick start:
1. Put 'Data_PiG_IOR_Static.mat' into the data folder
2. Run main_testPiGFunctionalBosModel.m
3. You should see a plot that contains:
  a. The markers from 'Data_PiG_IOR_Static.mat' 
  b. The foot frame location for the Ior marker set (dashed lines) and the Pig marker set (solid lines)
  c. The functional bos model for the Ior marker set (dashed blue) and the Pig marker set (solid magenta)

After this it is best to go through the code to learn more. Any variables that you might want to change will be located at the top of the file.
